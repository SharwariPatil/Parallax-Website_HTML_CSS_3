        The natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and
        non-living things occurring naturally, meaning in this case not
        artificial. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some parts of
        Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living
        species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human
        survival and economic activity.[1] The concept of the natural
        environment can be distinguished as components: Complete ecological
        units that function as natural systems without massive civilized human
        intervention, including all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks,
        atmosphere, and natural phenomena that occur within their boundaries and
        their nature. Universal natural resources and physical phenomena that
        lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as
        energy, radiation, electric charge, and magnetism, not originating from
        civilized human actions. In contrast to the natural environment is the
        built environment. Built environments are where humans have
        fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and
        agricultural land conversion, the natural environment is greatly changed
        into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less extreme,
        such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, the
        modified environment.

        Biotic Components of Environment The ecosystemâ€™s biotic elements are the
        living things that make up the ecosystem. Examples of biotic factors
        include fungi, bacteria, animals, plants, and animals. Based on the
        source of energy, these biotic components can be further divided into
        producers, consumers, and decomposers. Producers: These comprise each
        and every autotroph. They produce food on their own using light energy,
        such as plants, green algae, and other organisms. Consumers: All
        heterotrophs that rely on producers for food, whether directly or
        indirectly, fall under this category. Herbivores, carnivores, omnivores,
        and parasites are additional categories for consumers. Decomposers:
        These include saprophytes, which use dead materials and its decay as
        food. When they begin interacting with one another, biotic and abiotic
        elements of an ecosystem become relevant. For instance, biotic
        components like plants serve as food for other living things. The soil
        is an abiotic component that supports plant growth by supplying
        nutrients and other necessary ingredients. Abiotic variables like soil,
        nutrients, and other abiotic components are created by and dependent on
        biotic components.
